A collection of data structures and algorithms written by me to help me learn about them.


* Free software: MIT license


Features
--------

* TODO

Usage
-----

1. Choose an algorithm or data structure to practice.
2. Open file in editor.
3. Erase contents and implement from scratch.
   * If you get stuck, you can do a `git diff` to see how you compare to the known working version.
4. When done, run associated tests.
5. After tests are successful, do a `git restore` on the file to get back to the original state.
