# Algorithms

A collection of data structures and algorithms written by me to help me learn about them.

* Free software: MIT license

# Features

* TODO

# Usage

1. Choose an algorithm or data structure to practice.
2. Open file in editor.
3. Erase contents and implement from scratch.
   * If you get stuck, you can do a `git diff` to see how you compare to the known working version.
4. When done, run associated tests.
5. After tests are successful, do a `git restore` on the file to get back to the original state.


# Credits

The algorithms and code were learned and inspired by the following:
* Python Data Structures and Algorithms, 3rd Edition
* Grokking Algorithms
* Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition

This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.
